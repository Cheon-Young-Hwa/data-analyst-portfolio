# < Project Summary >


### 1. Bike Sharing Demand: Forecast Use of City Bikeshare System
Predicting the number of rented bikes using historical bike usage and weather data is the goal of this project. Data analysis in almost all aspects is carried out from explanatory data analysis to preprocessing data to feature engineering to deploying a model to performance evaluation. Also, a wide variety of visualisation is presented during the project.

### 2. Mobile Game Cookie Cats with A/B Testing: To Move First Gate from level 30 to 40?
Run A/B testing to determine wheather to move a gate in the mobile game that forces users to purchase an in-app itema or wait for some time. Define control and test groups and set up null and alternative hypothesis. To select the right t-test, normality and homogeneity are tested. An interpretation of the test and its implication are also added at the end of the prjoect.
